    "text": "BioPlaces Traveled\n\n\nI grew up in Melbourne, Australia and was exposed to the wonders of the natural world from a very young age. I quickly learned that understanding the natural world would be what I wanted to do for my career. My family moved to Dallas, Texas in 2008, where I would finish highschool as a remarkably average student. I attended the University of Arkansas for my undergraduate career, where the freedom to learn what I was interested in allowed me to explore my curiosities unbounded. I graduated with degrees in chemistry, biology, and environmental science along with minors in physics and math. I wanted a strong foundation in the hard sciences so I could eventually build up to study the Earth as a system.\nI graduated in May 2020, right as the coronavirus pandemic took off. I admittedly didn’t what my next step was after my undergraduate career, and worked as a bartender for about a year and a half while doing research with Dr. Jihua Hao from the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science (BMSIS). We worked on modeling the thermodynamics of amino acid synthesis on Saturn’s moon Enceladus - in an attempt to evaluate its potential for abiogenesis in its liquid water ocean beneath its icy crust.\nI realized that I wanted a broader set of tools to be able to analyze data from the natural world. I decided that data science would be the perfect place to leverage the power of data and statistics to any problem I’m interested in, so I decided to attend UCSB’s Master of Environmental Data Science program.\nI am broadly interested in many topics across the natural world. I enjoy learning about evolutionary biology, earth systems and planetary science, cosmology, climate science, and astrobiology"

    "text": "Species extinction is a normal part of Earth’s natural history, as over 99.9% of species to ever have existed are now extinct1. Background extinction rates under normal conditions is expected to between 0.1 - 1 species of vertebrates to go extinct every 100 years per 10,000 species2. However, throughout Earth’s history there have been calamitous events such as asteroid impacts, volcanic eruptions, and sudden atmospheric changes that have rapidly changed the conditions on Earth to be unsuitable for life. The worst of these extinction events, the Permian extinction, is thought to have killed off 90% of all species on Earth.\nThe current species extinction rate is estimated to be between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than the normal background extinction rate3, which is enough to consider our current time period the 6th mass extinction event - due to various human activities.\n\n[Figure 1. The Big Five Mass Extinctions]\n\n\n\n\nChinese River DolphinTasmanian TigerDodo\n\n\nYou may be familiar with some of the species that have recently gone extinct due to human activity. Among these are the Chinese River dolphin, which lived in the Yangtze river of China and was last seen in 2007 - thought to be driven to extinction due to heavy use of the river for fishing, transportation and hydroelectricity,\n\n[Figure 2. The Chinese River Dolphin (Baiji)]\n\n\nThe Tasmanian Tiger which lived on Tasmania, a small island south east of Australia, and was hunted to extinction in the 1930s\n\n[Figure 3. Tasmanian Tiger (Thylacine)]\n\n\nAnd the famous Dodo bird, endemic to the island of Mauritius, it lacked adaptations to prevent its own extinction from hunting by sailors and habitat destruction in the late 17th century.\n\n[Figure 4. The dodo went extinct by 1681]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies provide us not only with important sources of medicine, food and various other products, but also play important roles in each of their respective ecosystems on which much of our societies’ depend. Each species also helps us elucidate the story of life’s history on Earth and contextualizes our relationship with the natural world. More importantly however, species have intrinsic value regardless of what they provide for humans, and each one lost is a tragedy in its own right.\nIts important to understand the factors that render species vulnerable to extinction, as well as what the mechanisms of extinction are and how they work. Extinction is notoriously difficult to study mainly due to our lack of data which I will expand upon in the issues section, but we can hopefully use some of these findings to identify vulnerable species, and better protect them and their ecosystems from extinction and collapse."

    "section": "Modeling",
    "text": "Modeling\nI ran a logistic linear regression on each of these variables individually to get a feel for which levels might be significant. I then used an AIC function that added these variables stepwise into 5 different models, one for each added variable. It then scored each model using AIC, a relative way of evaluating model performance, to see which one did the best. I then used the best model to make some predictions. Comparing the coefficients of the variables from their individual models to their coefficients from the consolidated model, I was able evaluate the robustness of each variable. Since we’re testing a large number of levels in the variables, it is likely we will find significance regardless if there is actually an effect. Cross-checking the output of our individual models with our consolidated model allows us to see if our significant levels are robust.\nFirst, we’re going to look at using logistic regression on each variable individually. Our logistic regression uses the following logit function: \\[\\operatorname{logit}(p)=\\log \\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)=\\beta_0+\\beta_1  x + \\varepsilon \\]\nWhere \\(\\beta_0\\) is our intercept, and \\(\\beta_1\\) is the coefficient for a two-level factor variable that toggles on (\\(x = 1\\)) when we are not evaluating our reference category. For a variable with \\(i\\) levels, we will have \\(i - 1\\) terms of \\(\\beta\\). We will use this expression for each of our variables.\nUnfortunately, the model coefficients don’t tell us much since they’re log-transformed, and we have to re-transform to be able to interpret them. Taking endemism for example, after some rearranging we get an expression that we can use to calculate how much more likely an endemic species is to be extinct than a non-endemic species. We will use this approach for each significant level of our variables. \\[\\hat p = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x}}{1+ e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x}}\\]\nWe’re going to calculate the right hand side of our equation above for endemic species (\\(x = 1\\)) since its a categorical variable), and non-endemic species (\\(x = 0\\)). When we take the difference of the two, we calculate how much MORE likely it is for an endemic species to be extinct than a non-endemic species.\n\nEndemismHabitatThreatUseTaxonomy\n\n\nI first investigated endemism - a species endemic to Santa Barbra means it is found nowhere else in the world outside of Santa Barbara. This seemed like a good place to start, since an endemic species is geographically and genetically restricted to one location, which seems likely to render it more prone to extinction than a non-endemic species. Below is a mosaic plot - which uses area to visualize to categorical variables - to see if there is an obvious correlation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s difficult to tell, but it looks that endemic species might be more likely to also be extinct. We’re going to take a look at the logistic regression output for regressing extinct on endemic.\nHere is the R output for the model summary:\n\n\n\n\nTable 1. Logistic Regression of Extinction on Endemism\n\n \nEndemism\n\n\nPredictors\nOdds Ratios\nConf. Int (95%)\nP-value\n\n\nIntercept\n0.0177\n0.0166 – 0.0188\n<0.001\n\n\nEndemic\n2.0405\n1.8307 – 2.2718\n<0.001\n\n\nObservations\n70067\n\n\nR2 Tjur\n0.002\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince our p-value is far below any of the conventional significance levels, it looks like endemism on its own is significant in predicting extinction. After the transformation, our results show that an endemic species is 1.75% more likely to be extinct than a non-endemic species.\n\n\nI then investigated the type of habitat the species lives in. Running a logistic regression model only on habitat shows that the Cave habitat (our reference group, when \\(x = 0\\)) is significant - with a minimal p-value.\n\n\n\n\n\nWetlands and Forest habitats are also significant at a 0.05 significance level, and Marine Neritic habitats are significant at a significance level of 0.01. Let’s turn the coefficients into something more interpretable as we did above.\n\n\nProfiled confidence intervals may take longer time to compute.\n  Use `ci_method=\"wald\"` for faster computation of CIs.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.

Species threatened by Invasive species/Disease and pollution have a 8.16% and 1.1% more chance of being extinct than species threatened by Agriculture/Aquaculture, respectively.\n\n\nUse seemed like another appropriate variable to investigate. Perhaps species that provide medicinal or energy uses are extracted at more unsustainable rates than a species that provides an artisinal use.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.

A potential problem with this though, is the amount of missing data in this column. Out of our over 70,000 species observations, approximately 51,000 of these do not have associated use cases. This may be because we simply don’t have a human use for many species, or that the uses just aren’t properly documented.\n\n\nTaxonomy seemed like another interesting variable to investigate. It seems likely that more closely-related species will face similar extinction pressures. Since we’re working within the Animalia Kingdom, we will run a logistic regression using the class of each species. I’ve shortened the output below to only include a few of the classes for visual purposes.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.

Especially significant classes appear to be, Actinopterygii (Ray-finned fishes, our reference group) Amphibians, Arachnids, Aves, Bivalves, and Gastropods. Since we’re testing so many levels, we expect that our model will find significance regardless if there is an actual effect. We will keep an eye on the significant classes as we build our larger model. Below is a dendrogram of the evolutionary relationships between classes and their significance levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStepwise Model\nNow, we want to see if any of these significant levels of previous variables are still significant when we start to add our variables together for a more complete model. If they are still significant, we can be comfortable concluding that the level is influencing extinction. We start with predicting extinction off of one variable, endemism, and then incrementally add our other variables of interest. We use a stepwise AIC function - which will take a look at each step, and output scores for each step of the model, indicating which model does the best job at predicting extinction.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n      \n    K \n    AICc \n    Delta_AICc \n    AICcWt \n    LL \n  \n \n\n  \n    5 \n    56 \n    1615.0 \n    0.0 \n    1 \n    -751.2 \n  \n  \n    4 \n    47 \n    8794.1 \n    7179.1 \n    0 \n    -4350.0 \n  \n  \n    3 \n    18 \n    8985.0 \n    7370.0 \n    0 \n    -4474.5 \n  \n  \n    2 \n    10 \n    11713.7 \n    10098.7 \n    0 \n    -5846.9 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    2 \n    14210.9 \n    12595.9 \n    0 \n    -7103.5 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe last step in our model has the lowest AIC score, and appears to be the best. This is slightly worrying, since it is the most complicated model - it uses 56 different parameters (1 for each level of each variable) to predict extinction. This could potentially indicate over-fitting, so we’re going to take a look at our coefficients and p-values of our significant variable levels, to see which levels remain robust. Again, I’ve shortened the model output to include only the relevant levels.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.

This is a robust indicator.\nSimilarly, threats of Pollution and Invasive Species/Disease remain robust in our more complete model. The significance levels are far below the usual significance thresholds of 0.05 and 0.01, indicating that these are also a robust indicators.\nFinally, the Aves, Amphibia, and Gastropoda classes also look like they’re remaining robust - although Aves to a lesser degree. The significance level decreases quite a bit from when we evaluated taxa on their own, and the coefficient changes noticeably. This indicates that there may be an interaction effect between taxa and one of the other variables. Perhaps species in the Aves class (birds) are more prone to infectious diseases than species in other classes.\nSo, the variable levels that we are confident are associated with species extinction, at least in this dataset are endemic species threatened by pollution or disease, in the Aves, Amphibia, and Gastropoda classes. This is fairly consistent with our current knowledge of extinction.\n\n\nCode\ndendrogram_2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredictions\nI then used the step4 model models to make probability predictions that a species is extinct. Because the augment function that I used removes any NA values before making predictions, I used step4 model instead of step5. The use variable only contains data for ~ 20,000 of our 70,000 species - so we’d be losing well over half of our data if we used the step5 model. We’re still losing ~30,000 species with our step4 model, since not every species has an associated threat, so we expect our p-value in our T test to look slightly different.\nThe step4 model contains the variables endemic, habitat , threat and class. I then used augment to output the predicted probability that a species is extinct based on the variables used in the step4 model.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can evaluate how accurate the model is using a confusion matrix.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n      \n    0 \n    1 \n  \n \n\n  \n    0 \n    36524 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    1065 \n    1 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the model is 97% accurate, it is pretty bad at predicting if species are extinct or not. Here’s where machine learning comes into play."

    "text": "Limitations\nOn top of all this, it is extremely difficult to study extinction. We don’t have crucial data on population dynamics, geographic range, reproductive capacity, genetic diversity, and many other important factors for many species. In fact, there are probably still millions of species of plants and animals that we have yet to identify, let alone gather enough pertinent data to understand its status. The IUCN only describes species that went extinct relatively recently. When we consider the number of extinctions that have happened over geologic time scales, we are looking at an extremely minute sample. The IUCN has assessed only ~7% of its described species. Even for species that we are aware of, it is very difficult to tell if a species is actually extinct. The Amsterdam Widgeon was endemic to Île of Amsterdam in the French Southern Territories before it went extinct likely due to visiting sealers and the rats they introduced sometime between 1600 - 1800. No naturalist even visited the island until 1874, and we only know that it existed through its bones that were found in 19555. To illustrate an extreme example of how bad we are at this, we’ll take a look at the Coelecanths.\nThis ancient genus first appeared in the fossil record over 400 million years ago. It disappeared from the fossil record 66 million years ago and was presumed to have gone extinct along with the dinosaurs. In 1938, one species of Coelecanth was rediscovered in a fishing net off the South African Coast. Here it is, a living fossil, alive and swimming.\n\n[Figure 10. Live Coelecanth]\nSince then, another Coelecanth species has been discovered, and over 100 individual specimens have been recorded. Coelecanths are classified as critically endangered, the IUCN estimates that fewer than 500 exist in the wild, and are suffering as a result of over-fishing. This is one example of a Lazarus taxon - an evolutionary line that disappeared from the fossil record only to reappear much later."

    "text": "Misinformation\nFacebook uses a strike system to manage misinformation circulated on the app. Too many strikes in a 90-day period can result in a user being suspended from posting content, and reductions in circulation and advertisement revenue. However, accounts with large followings are given special treatment, as is the case with Breitbart, a well-known right-wing conspiratorial news site. Former president Donald Trump posted a video posted by Breitbart that encouraged viewers not to wear a mask for COVID-19 and to take hydroxychloroquine instead. Despite clearly violating their misinformation policy, the video was allowed to circulate and reach millions of people before it was taken down. Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, claimed that Breitbart wasn’t punished for the video, as it was the company’s only misinformation violation in a 90-day period2. Breitbart is a ‘managed partner’ with Facebook, where a facebook employee is assigned to watch the company’s posts and alert the company to edit posted material that contains misinformation. This system allows Breitbart to avoid strikes, as long as they edit their content after it has been spread around. Thus, Breitbart gets their content circulated, while Facebook gets to say that they’re working to prevent misinformation while profiting off of Breitbart’s material. Additionally, facebook executives also allow the removal of strikes to avoid de-listing any right wing managed partners. This is also an example of Facebook not wanting to upset its conservative users - allowing misinformation to spread instead. One employee wrote in the company’s internal chat: “We are apparently providing hate-speech-policy-consulting and consequence-mitigation services to select partners”3."

    "text": "Species extinction is a normal part of Earth’s natural history, as over 99.9% of species to ever have existed are now extinct1. Background extinction rates under normal conditions is expected to between 0.1 - 1 species of vertebrates to go extinct every 100 years per 10,000 species2. However, throughout Earth’s history there have been calamitous events such as asteroid impacts, volcanic eruptions, and sudden atmospheric changes that have rapidly changed the conditions on Earth to be unsuitable for life. The worst of these extinction events, the Permian extinction, is thought to have killed off 90% of all species on Earth.\nThe current species extinction rate is estimated to be between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than the normal background extinction rate3, which is enough to consider our current time period the 6th mass extinction event - due to various human activities.\n\n[Figure 1. The Big Five Mass Extinctions]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may be familiar with some of the species that have recently gone extinct due to human activity. Among these are the Chinese River dolphin, which lived in the Yangtze river of China and was last seen in 2007 - thought to be driven to extinction due to heavy use of the river for fishing, transportation and hydroelectricity,\n\n[Figure 2. The Chinese River Dolphin (Baiji)]\n\n\n\nThe Tasmanian Tiger which lived on Tasmania, a small island south east of Australia, and was hunted to extinction in the 1930s\n\n[Figure 3. Tasmanian Tiger (Thylacine)]\n\n\n\nAnd the famous Dodo bird, endemic to the island of Mauritius, it lacked adaptations to prevent its own extinction from hunting by sailors and habitat destruction in the late 17th century.\n\n[Figure 4. The dodo went extinct by 1681]\n\n\n\nSpecies provide us not only with important sources of medicine, food and various other products, but also play important roles in each of their respective ecosystems on which much of our societies’ depend. Each species also helps us elucidate the story of life’s history on Earth and contextualizes our relationship with the natural world. More importantly however, species have intrinsic value regardless of what they provide for humans, and each one lost is a tragedy in its own right.\nIts important to understand the factors that render species vulnerable to extinction, as well as what the mechanisms of extinction are and how they work. Extinction is notoriously difficult to study mainly due to our lack of data which I will expand upon in the issues section, but we can hopefully use some of these findings to identify vulnerable species, and better protect them and their ecosystems from extinction and collapse."

    "section": "Modeling",
    "text": "Modeling\nI ran a logistic linear regression on each of these variables individually to get a feel for which levels might be significant. I then used an AIC function that added these variables stepwise into 5 different models, one for each added variable. It then scored each model using AIC, a relative way of evaluating model performance, to see which one did the best. I then used the best model to make some predictions. Comparing the coefficients of the variables from their individual models to their coefficients from the consolidated model, I was able evaluate the robustness of each variable. Since we’re testing a large number of levels in the variables, it is likely we will find significance regardless if there is actually an effect. Cross-checking the output of our individual models with our consolidated model allows us to see if our significant levels are robust.\nFirst, we’re going to look at using logistic regression on each variable individually. Our logistic regression uses the following logit function: \\[\\operatorname{logit}(p)=\\log \\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)=\\beta_0+\\beta_1  x + \\varepsilon \\]\nWhere \\(\\beta_0\\) is our intercept, and \\(\\beta_1\\) is the coefficient for a two-level factor variable that toggles on (\\(x = 1\\)) when we are not evaluating our reference category. For a variable with \\(i\\) levels, we will have \\(i - 1\\) terms of \\(\\beta\\). We will use this expression for each of our variables.\nUnfortunately, the model coefficients don’t tell us much since they’re log-transformed, and we have to re-transform to be able to interpret them. Taking endemism for example, after some rearranging we get an expression that we can use to calculate how much more likely an endemic species is to be extinct than a non-endemic species. We will use this approach for each significant level of our variables. \\[\\hat p = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x}}{1+ e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x}}\\]\nWe’re going to calculate the right hand side of our equation above for endemic species (\\(x = 1\\)) since its a categorical variable), and non-endemic species (\\(x = 0\\)). When we take the difference of the two, we calculate how much MORE likely it is for an endemic species to be extinct than a non-endemic species.\n\nEndemism\nI first investigated endemism - a species endemic to Santa Barbra means it is found nowhere else in the world outside of Santa Barbara. This seemed like a good place to start, since an endemic species is geographically and genetically restricted to one location, which seems likely to render it more prone to extinction than a non-endemic species. Below is a mosaic plot - which uses area to visualize to categorical variables - to see if there is an obvious correlation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s difficult to tell, but it looks that endemic species might be more likely to also be extinct. We’re going to take a look at the logistic regression output for regressing extinct on endemic.\nHere is the R output for the model summary:\n\n\n\n\nTable 1. Logistic Regression of Extinction on Endemism\n\n \nEndemism\n\n\nPredictors\nOdds Ratios\nConf. Int (95%)\nP-value\n\n\nIntercept\n0.0177\n0.0166 – 0.0188\n<0.001\n\n\nEndemic\n2.0405\n1.8307 – 2.2718\n<0.001\n\n\nObservations\n70067\n\n\nR2 Tjur\n0.002\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince our p-value is far below any of the conventional significance levels, it looks like endemism on its own is significant in predicting extinction. After the transformation, our results show that an endemic species is 1.75% more likely to be extinct than a non-endemic species.\n\n\nHabitat\nI then investigated the type of habitat the species lives in. Running a logistic regression model only on habitat shows that the Cave habitat (our reference group, when \\(x = 0\\)) is significant - with a minimal p-value.\n\n\n\n\n\nWetlands and Forest habitats are also significant at a 0.05 significance level, and Marine Neritic habitats are significant at a significance level of 0.01. Let’s turn the coefficients into something more interpretable as we did above.\n\n\nProfiled confidence intervals may take longer time to compute.\n  Use `ci_method=\"wald\"` for faster computation of CIs.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.

Species threatened by Invasive species/Disease and pollution have a 8.16% and 1.1% more chance of being extinct than species threatened by Agriculture/Aquaculture, respectively.\n\n\nUse\nUse seemed like another appropriate variable to investigate. Perhaps species that provide medicinal or energy uses are extracted at more unsustainable rates than a species that provides an artisinal use.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.

A potential problem with this though, is the amount of missing data in this column. Out of our over 70,000 species observations, approximately 51,000 of these do not have associated use cases. This may be because we simply don’t have a human use for many species, or that the uses just aren’t properly documented.\n\n\nTaxonomy\nTaxonomy seemed like another interesting variable to investigate. It seems likely that more closely-related species will face similar extinction pressures. Since we’re working within the Animalia Kingdom, we will run a logistic regression using the class of each species. I’ve shortened the output below to only include a few of the classes for visual purposes.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.

Especially significant classes appear to be, Actinopterygii (Ray-finned fishes, our reference group) Amphibians, Arachnids, Aves, Bivalves, and Gastropods. Since we’re testing so many levels, we expect that our model will find significance regardless if there is an actual effect. We will keep an eye on the significant classes as we build our larger model. Below is a dendrogram of the evolutionary relationships between classes and their significance levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStepwise Model\nNow, we want to see if any of these significant levels of previous variables are still significant when we start to add our variables together for a more complete model. If they are still significant, we can be comfortable concluding that the level is influencing extinction. We start with predicting extinction off of one variable, endemism, and then incrementally add our other variables of interest. We use a stepwise AIC function - which will take a look at each step, and output scores for each step of the model, indicating which model does the best job at predicting extinction.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n      \n    K \n    AICc \n    Delta_AICc \n    AICcWt \n    LL \n  \n \n\n  \n    5 \n    56 \n    1615.0 \n    0.0 \n    1 \n    -751.2 \n  \n  \n    4 \n    47 \n    8794.1 \n    7179.1 \n    0 \n    -4350.0 \n  \n  \n    3 \n    18 \n    8985.0 \n    7370.0 \n    0 \n    -4474.5 \n  \n  \n    2 \n    10 \n    11713.7 \n    10098.7 \n    0 \n    -5846.9 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    2 \n    14210.9 \n    12595.9 \n    0 \n    -7103.5 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe last step in our model has the lowest AIC score, and appears to be the best. This is slightly worrying, since it is the most complicated model - it uses 56 different parameters (1 for each level of each variable) to predict extinction. This could potentially indicate over-fitting, so we’re going to take a look at our coefficients and p-values of our significant variable levels, to see which levels remain robust. Again, I’ve shortened the model output to include only the relevant levels.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.

This is a robust indicator.\nSimilarly, threats of Pollution and Invasive Species/Disease remain robust in our more complete model. The significance levels are far below the usual significance thresholds of 0.05 and 0.01, indicating that these are also a robust indicators.\nFinally, the Aves, Amphibia, and Gastropoda classes also look like they’re remaining robust - although Aves to a lesser degree. The significance level decreases quite a bit from when we evaluated taxa on their own, and the coefficient changes noticeably. This indicates that there may be an interaction effect between taxa and one of the other variables. Perhaps species in the Aves class (birds) are more prone to infectious diseases than species in other classes.\nSo, the variable levels that we are confident are associated with species extinction, at least in this dataset are endemic species threatened by pollution or disease, in the Aves, Amphibia, and Gastropoda classes. This is fairly consistent with our current knowledge of extinction.\n\n\nCode\ndendrogram_2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredictions\nI then used the step4 model models to make probability predictions that a species is extinct. Because the augment function that I used removes any NA values before making predictions, I used step4 model instead of step5. The use variable only contains data for ~ 20,000 of our 70,000 species - so we’d be losing well over half of our data if we used the step5 model. We’re still losing ~30,000 species with our step4 model, since not every species has an associated threat, so we expect our p-value in our T test to look slightly different.\nThe step4 model contains the variables endemic, habitat , threat and class. I then used augment to output the predicted probability that a species is extinct based on the variables used in the step4 model.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can evaluate how accurate the model is using a confusion matrix.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n      \n    0 \n    1 \n  \n \n\n  \n    0 \n    36524 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    1065 \n    1 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the model is 97% accurate, it is pretty bad at predicting if species are extinct or not. Here’s where machine learning comes into play."

    "text": "Limitations\nOn top of all this, it is extremely difficult to study extinction. We don’t have crucial data on population dynamics, geographic range, reproductive capacity, genetic diversity, and many other important factors for many species. In fact, there are probably still millions of species of plants and animals that we have yet to identify, let alone gather enough pertinent data to understand its status. The IUCN only describes species that went extinct relatively recently. When we consider the number of extinctions that have happened over geologic time scales, we are looking at an extremely minute sample. The IUCN has assessed only ~7% of its described species. Even for species that we are aware of, it is very difficult to tell if a species is actually extinct. The Amsterdam Widgeon was endemic to Île of Amsterdam in the French Southern Territories before it went extinct likely due to visiting sealers and the rats they introduced sometime between 1600 - 1800. No naturalist even visited the island until 1874, and we only know that it existed through its bones that were found in 19555. To illustrate an extreme example of how bad we are at this, we’ll take a look at the Coelecanths.\nThis ancient genus first appeared in the fossil record over 400 million years ago. It disappeared from the fossil record 66 million years ago and was presumed to have gone extinct along with the dinosaurs. In 1938, one species of Coelecanth was rediscovered in a fishing net off the South African Coast. Here it is, a living fossil, alive and swimming.\n\n[Figure 10. Live Coelecanth]\nSince then, another Coelecanth species has been discovered, and over 100 individual specimens have been recorded. Coelecanths are classified as critically endangered, the IUCN estimates that fewer than 500 exist in the wild, and are suffering as a result of over-fishing. This is one example of a Lazarus taxon - an evolutionary line that disappeared from the fossil record only to reappear much later."
