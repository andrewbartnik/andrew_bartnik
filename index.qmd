# **Welcome!**

I'm an aspiring Environmental Data Scientist/Machine Learning Scientist recently graduated from the Masters of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program at University of California, Santa Barbara's Bren School of the Environmental Science & Management. I am broadly interested in the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to understand complex earth systems and environmental problems. I will be posting each of my data science projects here as I complete them.
