# **Welcome!**

I'm an aspiring Environmental Data Scientist/Machine Learning Scientist recently graduated from the Masters of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program at University of California, Santa Barbara's Bren School of the Environmental Science & Management in June 2023. I am broadly interested in all topics across the natural world, including evolutionary biology, astrobiology, planetary science and oceanography, and biosphere and Earth interactions. I am passionate (and optimistic) about the application of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence to understand complex natural systems. I am comfortable in using R and Python programming languages and various other data science tools. I will be posting each of my data science projects here as I complete them. Thanks for stopping by!
